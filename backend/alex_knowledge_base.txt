Alex's Steam Market Analysis Knowledge Base
===========================================

QUALITY SIGNALS (in order of reliability):

1. RECOMMENDATIONS (Most Reliable)
   - Total "thumbs up" from Steam users - official endorsement
   - MORE reliable than reviews (harder to manipulate)
   - 100+ recommendations = decent quality signal
   - 1,000+ recommendations = strong quality
   - 10,000+ recommendations = exceptional
   - NOTE: ~70% of indie games have <100 recommendations

2. METACRITIC SCORE
   - Professional critic score (0-100)
   - NULL for ~70% of games (mostly indie - critics don't review everything)
   - When present: 75+ = good, 80+ = very good, 85+ = exceptional
   - Use for comparisons with big titles, but DON'T penalize indies for missing scores

3. POSITIVE REVIEWS
   - User reviews on Steam
   - Can be manipulated (review bombing, fake reviews)
   - Best used alongside recommendations for validation
   - High reviews + low recommendations = potential manipulation red flag

MARKET REACH INDICATORS:

1. CROSS-PLATFORM SUPPORT
   - Windows only: Standard (95% of games)
   - Windows + Mac: Wider reach (~60% market expansion)
   - Windows + Mac + Linux: Maximum reach (smaller but dedicated market)
   - Pattern: Cross-platform games tend to have 20-30% more total owners

2. LANGUAGE SUPPORT
   - 1-3 languages: English-only or minimal localization
   - 4-9 languages: Standard localization (EU focus)
   - 10+ languages: Serious international strategy (includes Asian markets)
   - Chinese + Russian = targeting massive markets (50%+ global PC gamers)

MONETIZATION PATTERNS:

1. DLC COUNT
   - 0 DLC: One-time purchase model
   - 1-3 DLC: Expansion pack strategy
   - 4-10 DLC: Active post-launch support
   - 10+ DLC: Heavy monetization (cosmetics, season passes)
   - Pattern: Successful games with 5+ DLC = strong ongoing revenue

2. PRICING + DLC RELATIONSHIP
   - Budget ($0-$5) + 10+ DLC = F2P-style monetization
   - Standard ($10-$30) + 3-5 DLC = Traditional expansion model
   - Premium ($40+) + lots of DLC = AAA model

ENGAGEMENT METRICS:

1. ACHIEVEMENT COUNT
   - 10-20 achievements: Standard
   - 20-50 achievements: Replayability focus
   - 50+ achievements: Heavy engagement mechanics
   - Pattern: High achievement count correlates with longer avg_hours_played
   - But: Some amazing games have 0 achievements (often indie)

2. HOURS PER DOLLAR
   - <5 hours/$: Short experience or poor value
   - 5-20 hours/$: Standard value
   - 20-50 hours/$: Great value
   - 50+ hours/$: Exceptional value (or F2P)
   - Pattern: Games with 30+ hours/$ tend to have "Very Positive" ratings

PRACTICAL INSIGHTS FOR QUERIES:

When users ask about "quality" games:
- Prioritize recommendations >100 AND rating_percentage >80
- Don't filter out games missing metacritic_score (hurts indies unfairly)
- Look for engagement_score >70 as secondary signal

When users ask about "successful" games:
- total_owners is the key metric
- Cross-reference with recommendations (high owners + low recommendations = bundle padding)
- Check dlc_count for ongoing revenue (not just launch sales)

When users ask about platform strategy:
- Windows-only is FINE for first launch (95% of market)
- Mac worth considering if your game is casual/creative/educational
- Linux is niche but loyal (consider for retro/indie/simulation genres)

When users ask about international markets:
- English + Chinese + Russian = 70% of global PC gamers
- Spanish + Portuguese = Latin America (growing market)
- Japanese + Korean = high-value niche markets
- Use language_count as proxy for international ambition

RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:

- High positive_reviews but low recommendations = potential manipulation
- High total_owners but very low avg_hours_played = bundle fodder
- Price drops >70% shortly after launch = desperation pricing
- Zero DLC after 2+ years + high owners = abandoned game
- Very high achievement_count but low engagement_score = achievement spam

TAG AND GENRE SEARCHING (CRITICAL):

**ALWAYS use case-insensitive search for tags and genres!**

Correct approaches:
- ILIKE operator: `WHERE top_tags ILIKE '%fps%'`
- LOWER function: `WHERE LOWER(top_tags) LIKE '%fps%'`
- LOWER with genres: `WHERE LOWER(genres) LIKE '%action%'`

❌ WRONG (case-sensitive, will miss results):
`WHERE top_tags LIKE '%FPS%'`  -- Misses "fps", "Fps", "First-Person Shooter"

✅ CORRECT examples:
- Find FPS games: `WHERE LOWER(top_tags) ILIKE '%fps%'`
- Find action games: `WHERE LOWER(genres) ILIKE '%action%'`
- Multiple tags: `WHERE LOWER(top_tags) ILIKE '%fps%' AND LOWER(top_tags) ILIKE '%multiplayer%'`

Common tag formats:
- "FPS, Shooter, Multiplayer" (capitalized)
- "fps, first-person, action" (lowercase)
- "First-Person Shooter, Action" (title case)

DATA LIMITATIONS (be honest about these):

- Metacritic score missing for 70% of games (mostly indie)
- Recommendations scale with total_owners (older games have advantage)
- Cross-platform data doesn't tell us SALES per platform
- Language count doesn't tell us quality of localization
- DLC count doesn't tell us revenue per DLC
- Tags and genres are comma-separated text (not normalized)

ANSWER PATTERNS:

"Show me quality indie games":
- recommendations >100 (or >50 for very small indies)
- rating_percentage >75
- avg_hours_played >10
- DON'T require metacritic_score (unfair to indies)

"What makes a game successful?":
- total_owners (primary)
- recommendations/owner ratio >0.01 (1% recommendation rate = engaged audience)
- dlc_count >3 (ongoing support = ongoing revenue)
- Cross-platform support (wider reach)

"Should I add achievements?":
- Look at similar games with achievement_count >30
- Compare their avg_hours_played vs games with fewer achievements
- Give data-driven answer, not generic advice
