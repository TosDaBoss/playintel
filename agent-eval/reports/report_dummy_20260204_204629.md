## Improvement Suggestions

- **Table Usage**: Review when tables are appropriate. Use tables for comparative data (3+ items) but prefer prose for simple answers.
- **Variability**: Diversify response structures and openings. Avoid starting every response the same way.
- **Vary Openings**: Responses start too similarly. Use different opening structures based on the query type.
